Reversible Logic Synthesis Benchmarks in OpenQASM2.0

[Reversible Logic Synthesis Benchmarks Page](https://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~dmaslov/) is a useful quantum programms for benchmarking reversible/quantum circuit optimization. The original contents are written in machine-readable format (.tfc file) and developed and maintained by Dmitri Maslov. 

This is a rewriting of Reversible Logic Synthesis Benchmarks in OpenQASM by [Shin Nishio](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gZNt8twAAAAJ&hl=ja). Feel free to contact me via issues for this repository or email to parton@sfc.wide.ad.jp
